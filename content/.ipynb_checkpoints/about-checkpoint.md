I am a data scientist with experience in big data and network analysis. I was a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, I was part of the R&D at Startup Network s.r.l., the lead data scientist at FXC Intel, and, currently,<img clear="none" align="right" src="/images/v.jpeg" style="height:250px" > I cover the position of AVP data scientist at Barclays UK. I was born in Italy, grew up in Belgium, and now living in the UK.


My background in physics and a doctorate in applied mathematics gave me a variety of tools and techniques that help me to carefully choose the best approach to solve un-structured problems.

I enjoy dealing with challenging projects that require an extra effort to find a solution that is not just the application of an out of the box ML algorithm. The possibility to combine techniques to solve problems projects . I believe in team work and in the power of brain-storming ideas which arise from the interaction with colleagues and friends.

I keep myself updated with new analytical techniques reading scientific papers and browsing online blogs.

Outside of the work environment, I like to run (I am planning to run my first half marathon!) and swim. But what I really love the most is the good cuisine (both eating and cooking!).
